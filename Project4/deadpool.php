        &nbsp; &nbsp; Deadpool (real name Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by
        Marvel Comics. Created by artist/writer Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New Mutants
        #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The
        New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a
        disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor granted to him by
        Dr. Emrys Killebrew of Weapon X and physical prowess. He is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature
        and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags.
