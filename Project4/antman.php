        &nbsp; &nbsp; Ant-Man is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
        Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #27 (Sept. 1962). The persona was
        originally the superhero alias of the brilliant scientist Hank Pym after inventing a substance that allowed him to change size,
        however, Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady have also taken on the Ant-Man mantle.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; A live-action film, featuring Scott Lang and Hank Pym, titled Ant-Man, was released on July 17, 2015. The film
        is directed by Peyton Reed, with a screenplay by Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish and Adam McKay & Paul Rudd from a story by Wright
        and Cornish. Wright was slated to direct the film but left the project in May 2014 due to creative differences with the studio.
        In November 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that aspects of Eric O'Grady's Ant-Man would not be featured in the film. In December
        2013, Paul Rudd was cast as Ant-Man, followed in January 2014 with the casting of Michael Douglas as Pym, and the confirmation
        of Rudd as Lang.
